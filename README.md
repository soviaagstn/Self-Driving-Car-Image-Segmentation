# Self-Driving-Car-Image-Segmentation

There are several algorithms that can be used to build Image Segmentation models for self-driving cars or autonomous driving car, such as the UNet architecture, FCN, and others.

For this time, I used the **"UNet architecture"** to model the Image Segmentation, more specifically **"Semantic Segmentation"**. 
I chose the UNet architecture because based on the existing literature on UNet, it is able to increase the accuracy of the model compared to FCN.
